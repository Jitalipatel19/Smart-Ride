# Smart Ride – Monthly Pickup & Drop Subscription Platform
## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Ride is a subscription-based transportation platform designed to streamline monthly pickup and drop services for daily commuters such as office employees and students. 

The platform replaces manual coordination with a centralized digital system that manages users, drivers, routes, subscriptions, and payments efficiently.
## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional pickup and drop services rely heavily on manual coordination, which leads to:
- Inefficient route management
- Difficulty in handling monthly subscriptions
- Poor communication between users, drivers, and administrators
- Lack of centralized tracking and management system

Smart Ride aims to solve these issues by providing an automated, subscription-based platform.
## 🎯 Primary Objectives

- Provide a monthly subscription-based pickup and drop service
- Enable administrators to manage users, drivers, and routes centrally
- Improve operational efficiency through structured scheduling
- Offer a user-friendly and scalable platform
## 🎯 Secondary Objectives
